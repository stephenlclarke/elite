# Issue 176: owned cabin identifier

## Motivation

The unfiltered quality run [40043514103](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/elite/actions/runs/40043514103) for PR25 head `ae97d337cb9cf25b58322a21946e9ece297dd60a` failed. Its saved evidence records 62 assertion-bearing methods and a separate terminal SIGBUS. The earlier 19-method and 524-method passes remain limited to their recorded scopes.

## Scope and correction

Pass the offered berth's cabinID to the cabin-module fitting API, keeping the actual empty-owned-module guard and withdrawal checks.

Original assertion locations for this group: NativeOrbitalOutlookJourneyTests.swift:187. The independent full inventory is recorded in `docs/evidence/M01-ae97-terminal-review.json`.

## Validation and compatibility

Source review is complete for the coherent correction batch. Unit execution is pending; these changes are not qualified for integration or release. One combined normal affected-unit batch must retain all 62 methods, including the unresolved moving-debris case. Swift actor ownership, save authority, original data, solver budgets and required quality gates stay unchanged.

## Links and remaining risks

[GitHub issue 176](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/elite/issues/176); [PR25](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/elite/pull/25). The moving-debris sweep remains unresolved; debug-only scalar refusal logging collects its actual query without changing the result. Issue185 remains unattributed. Full coverage, sanitizers, leaks, final review and protected release publication remain pending.

## First combined normal execution

Source `6423e889ab76109f04821e4159fb110be0f9b779` compiled successfully in284.84seconds and completed135 methods in39.895seconds (326.039040208seconds overall). The actual XML records131 passing methods, four failing methods and six failure elements, with zero errors or skips. Every one of the original62 failure methods completed;60 passed. The [per-method receipt](evidence/M01-authored-fixture-unit-results.json) preserves exact selection, durations and status. This is a failed aggregate, not full quality or release qualification.

Remaining failures are the actual -3000 debris/NPC continuation, peaceful classic-frame shield normalization, recovered ECM baseline normalization and a bounded ore-recovery timeout interrupted by game over. Issue186 records the conservative affine-enclosure candidate; three fixture corrections accompany its focused follow-up. No SIGBUS occurred in this run. Issue185 remains unattributed and open, independent of these assertion results.
